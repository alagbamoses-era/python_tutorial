Chapter 5. Python Data Structure I: Lists, Tuples, and Dictionary 

Sequences are another basic type of data structure in Python. Each 
element in a sequence, be it a list, tuple, or dictionary, is assigned 
an index that marks its position. The first index is always zero, the 
second is one and so on. Python has six in-built types of sequences but 
the most common that every beginner should learn are lists, tuples and 
dictionary.


Lists 

A list is basically an ordered sequence of items. In Python, lists are 
among the most popular sequence data types because they are flexible 
(the items do not need to be of the same type), and declaring them is 
quite easy. Items in a list are enclosed within square brackets [ ] 
and are separated by commas. 

Creating a list in Python 

To create a list in Python, enclose items in square brackets separated 
by commas and assign it a variable.
 
Exercise22.py: Creating lists



weekdays = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday"] 
yearlist = [2017, "Two Thousand and Seventeen", "XXVII", 20.17] 
favorites = ["a", "x", "i", "xx"] 
print (weekdays) 

Just as in string indices, elements of a list are indexed starting 
at 0. They can be concatenated, sliced and so on.


Accessing values in a list 

To access the values of a list, we use square bracket slicing and 
refer to the values using the index or indices. Try it out in 
Exercise23. 

Exercise23: Accessing list values 
months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", 
"Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"] 

print ("The first month is", months[0]) 
print ("The 5th to 9th months are", months[4:9]) 
print ("The second last month is", months[-2]) 
print (months[6:], "make up the last half of the year")


Updating a list 

You can update a single element or multiple elements of a list 
simultaneously by specifying the slice on the left side of the 
assignment operator. Try it in the next exercise. 

Exercise24: Updating a list 

subjects = ["Math", "Physics", "Chemistry"] 

print ("List of subjects:", subjects) 

subjects[2] = "Biology" 

print ("New list of subjects: ", subjects) 

To add elements to a list, you use the append() function as in 
Exercise24. 

Exercise25: Appending a new item to a list 
subjects = ["Math", "Physics", "Chemistry"] 
print ("List of subjects:", subjects) 
subjects[2] = "Biology" 

print ("New number of subjects: ", subjects) 
Note that the append() function allows you to add only one item 
at a time.


subjects.append('Computer Science')

print(subjects)


Deleting an element in a list 

There are two ways you can delete an element in a list. You can 
use the del statement if you know the exact element or 
elements you wish to delete or the remove() method if you do not. 
Let us put both these in practice in the next exercise. 

Exercise26: Deleting an item in a list 
subjects = ["Math", "Physics", "Chemistry", "Biology", "History"] 
print ("List of subjects:", subjects) 

del subjects[2] 
print ("New list of subjects after del: ", subjects) 
subjects.remove("Physics") 
print ("New list of subjects after subjects.remove:", subjects)

Basic list operations 

Just like strings, lists can be manipulated using operators such 
as + to concatenate and * to iterate. Generally speaking, lists 
respond to all the general sequence operations that we used on 
strings in the previous chapter. Try out the operations in 
Exercise27 to have a better grasp of what each does. 

Exercise27: Basic lists operations 
fruits = ["Mango", "Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Pear"] 
numbers1 = [1, 2, "three", 4] 
numbers2 = [7, "x", "p", 10] 
print ("The length of the fruits list is", len(fruits)) 

numbers = numbers1 + numbers2 
print (numbers) 
print (numbers1 * 2) 
print (10 in numbers2) 
for x in [1, 2, 3]: print (x) 

The following table summarizes the built-in methods and functions 
that you can use to manipulate lists in Python:


Function		Description 
cmp(list1, list2)	Compares the elements of two lists. 
len(list)		Returns the total length of the list. 
max(list)		Returns the item with max value from the list. 
min(list)		Returns the item with min value from the list. 
list(seq)		Converts a tuple into list. 

The following list methods are built into Python: 

Method			Description 
list.append(x)		Appends an object x to list 
list.count(x)		Returns the count of how many times x occurs in 
			list 
list.extend(seq)	Appends the contents of seq to list 
list.index(x)		Returns the lowest index in list that x appears 
list.insert(index, x)	Inserts object x into list at the specified index 
list.pop(x=list[-1])	Removes and returns last object or x from list 
list.remove(x)		Removes object x from list 
list.reverse()		Reverses the list of objects 
list.sort([func])	Sorts objects of list using compare func (if 


Tuples 

Similar to list, a tuple is an ordered sequence of items. The only 
difference between it and a list is that a tuple is immutable. This 
means that once it has been created, it cannot be modified.
 
Tuples are used to create write-protected data. Because they are not 
dynamic, they are often faster than lists. A tuple is defined within 
parentheses () and the values are separated by commas. Like lists, a 
tuple can contain values of different data types. 

my_tuple = (5, "2017", 1+3j) 

The slicing operator we used on strings and lists [] can be used to 
extract the items in a tuple, but values cannot be changed. 

tuple2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ) 

An empty tuple is basically two parentheses with nothing between them 
empty_tuple = () 

To create a tuple with only one value, it must include a comma.

 Like this: 
Year = (2017,) 

Just like strings and lists, the values within a tuples are references 
with indices that start at 0 and can be concatenated, sliced, and so on.	provided)


Accessing values in a tuple 

Use the square bracket to slice along the index or indices and access 
the values of a tuple as in Exercise29. 

Exercise29: Accessing values in a tuple 

continents = ("Asia", "Africa", "Americas", "Europe", "Australia") 

print ("continents[0]:", continents[0]) 

print ("continents[2:]", continents[2:]) 

print ("continents[:-3]", continents[:-3])



Updating a tuple 

Tuples are immutable, which means that the tuple elements or values 
between the brackets cannot be changed or updated. However, you can 
take the values from an existing tuple and create a new tuple as 
demonstrated in Exercise30. 

Exercise30: Updating a tuple 

continents = ("Asia", "Africa", "Americas", "Europe", "Australia") 

continents2 = ("Antarctica",) 

all_continents = continents + continents2 

print (all_continents)


Deleting tuple elements 

It is not possible to remove individual values of a tuple. Therefore, 
the only option, as we saw with updating tuple values in Exercise30, 
is to create another tuple from the values of an existing tuple, 
discarding the undesired elements. 

To delete an entire tuple, you can use the del statement. The syntax 
looks like this: 

del tuple 

Where tuple is the name of the tuple to delete.



Basic tuple operations
 
As we have already learned, tuples respond to most operators we used 
on strings and lists including + for concatenation and * for iteration. 
Generally speaking, tuples respond to all the operations we have used 
on strings. 

Therefore, we will not repeat them in this section. For your free 
practice time, find out which operations from strings and lists can 
be applied to tuples and find out what results they return.



DICTIONARIES 

A dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of items separated by 
commas and enclosed in curly braces. Unlike other compound data types 
such as a list and a tuple which have only one value for an element, a 
dictionary has a pair of key and value separated by a colon. An empty 
dictionary without values will have empty curly braces. 

The values of a dictionary may be any data type, but the data type of 
the keys must be immutable such as numbers, strings, or tuples.

Dictionaries in Python are optimized to retrieve paired values using the 
element key.

Creating a dictionary 

To create a dictionary, simply place item pairs separated by commas 
inside curly braces {}. 

Each item must have a key and a corresponding value in the format key: 
value. 

Exercise31: Creating dictionaries 

empty_dict = {} 

integerkey_dict = {1: "Mango", 2: "Apple", 3: "Orange"} 

mixedkey_dict = {"name": "John", 0: [2, 4, 3]} 

print (integerkey_dict) 
print (mixedkey_dict) 

We can also create a dictionary using the built-in function dict().
Accessing elements of a dictionary 

While we used indexes to access the values of strings, tuples, and 
lists, with dictionaries, we use keys. To access an element in a 
dictionary, we use a key inside a square bracket or the get() method. 

Exercise32: Accessing dictionary elements 

my_dict = {"name":"John", "age": 21, "occupation":"Programmer"} 

print (my_dict["name"]) 

print (my_dict.get('age')) 

work = my_dict.get("occupation") 

print (work) 

If you use the square bracket method to access a key does not exist in 
the dictionary, it will return an KeyError but if you use the get() method 
it will return None instead.

Adding, deleting, and modifying elements in a dictionary 

Because a dictionary is a mutable data type, you can add new or delete 
or update existing elements. If the key of the element you are changing 
exists, the value will get updated, else a new key: value pair will be 
created and added to the dictionary. 

Exercise33: Deleting and updating dictionary elements 

student = {"name": "John Doe", "age": 25, "grade": "B+"} 

print ("Before update:", student) 

print ("\nChange age to 30:\nAdd Sex key:value pair") 

student["age"] = 30 

student["sex"] = "Male" 

print ("\nAfter update:", student) 

print ("Delete grade entry:") 

del student["grade"] 

print ("After deleting grade:", student) 

When you run Exercise33.py, you will learn that: 

1.  You can update the value of a key in the dictionary by assigning 
it a new value using the traditional = operator. 

2.  You can create a new key:value pair by assigning a non-existent 
key a new value as in student["sex"] = "Male". 

3.  You can remove an individual dictionary element using the del 
operator.
 
You can also remove all the contents of a dictionary in a single 
operation using the dict.clear() method statement.

You can also delete the entire dictionary by using del dictionary 
operation where dictionary is the name of the dictionary. 

Here is a table summarizing the built-in methods and functions you can 
use to manipulate a dictionary in Python.

Function		Description 
cmp(dict1, dict2)	Compares the elements of dict1 to those of dict2. 

len(dict)		Returns the total length of the dictionary (the 
			number of items in the dictionary) 

str(dict)		Returns a printable string representation of the 
			dictionary 

type(variable)		Returns the type of the passed variable. 


The next table is a presentation of the methods that you can use to 
manipulate the elements of a dictionary: 

Methods			Description 
dict.clear()		Removes all the elements of the dictionary dict 

dict.copy()		Returns a shallow copy of the dictionary dict 

dict.fromkeys()		Creates a new dictionary with keys from seq with 
			values set to value. 

dict.get(x, default=None) Returns the value of key x in the dict dictionary 
			  or  default if the does not exist. 

dict.has_key(x)		Returns True if key x is in dictionary dict, 
			otherwise False 

dict.items()		Returns a list of dict's (key, value) pairs in tuple 
			format. 

dict.keys()		Returns list of keys of the dict dictionary. 

dict.setdefault(x,default=None) Returns the value of key x in the dict 
			dictionary or set dict[key] = default if key does 
			not exist. 

dict.update(dict2)	Adds dictionary key:value pairs from dict to dict 

dict.values()		Returns a list of values from the dict dictionary.


Properties of dictionary keys 

While the values of a dictionary in Python have no restriction – they can 
be made up of any arbitrary objects or data types, which include standard 
or user-defined objects – keys are different. There are two vital points 
you must know about dictionary keys in Python: 

1. You cannot enter more than one key in a dictionary. This means you 
cannot have duplicate keys in a single dictionary. 

2. Unlike values, keys are immutable. This means you can use types such as 
strings, tuples, and strings as keys, but you cannot define a key using 
something like [“Key”).



Set Data Structure

In Python, a set is an unordered collection of unique elements. Sets are 
useful when you need to store distinct values and perform operations like 
unions, intersections, and differences.


---

Creating Sets

You can create a set using curly braces {} or the set() constructor:

# Using curly braces
my_set = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

# Using set() function
my_set2 = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])  # From a list

# Creating an empty set (MUST use set())
empty_set = set()  # Correct
wrong_set = {}     # This creates an empty dictionary, NOT a set!


print(type(empty_set))  # <class 'set'>
print(type(wrong_set))  # <class 'dict'>





Basic Operations

Adding Elements

s = {1, 2, 3}
s.add(4)  # Adds a single element
print(s)  # {1, 2, 3, 4}

Removing Elements

s.remove(2)  # Removes 2; raises an error if not found

s.discard(5)  # Removes 5 if it exists; otherwise does nothing

print(s)

Set Length

print(len(s))  # Number of elements in the set



Checking Membership

print(3 in s)  # True
print(5 in s)  # False

---

Set Operations

Union (| or union())

Combines elements from both sets:

A = {1, 2, 3}
B = {3, 4, 5}

print(A | B)  # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

print(A.union(B))  # Same result

Intersection (& or intersection())

Finds common elements:

print(A & B)  # {3}


print(A.intersection(B))  # Same result




Difference (- or difference())

Elements in A but not in B:

print(A - B)  # {1, 2}
print(A.difference(B))  # Same result

Symmetric Difference (^ or symmetric_difference())

Elements that are in one set but not both:

print(A ^ B)  # {1, 2, 4, 5}
print(A.symmetric_difference(B))  # Same result


Set Comparisons

X = {1, 2}
Y = {1, 2, 3, 4}

print(X < Y)  # True (X is a proper subset of Y)
print(X.issubset(Y))  # True
print(Y.issuperset(X))  # True


Set Comprehension

You can create sets using comprehension:

squared = {x**2 for x in range(5)}
print(squared)  # {0, 1, 4, 9, 16}



Frozen Set (Immutable Set)

A frozenset is a read-only version of a set:

fs = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4])
# fs.add(5)  # ERROR: Cannot modify a frozenset
print(fs)



When to Use Sets?

When you need unique elements.

When you need fast membership testing (in is faster in sets than lists).

When performing set operations like union, intersection, etc.



In Python 3, a frozenset is an immutable version of a set. It has the 
same properties as a regular set, but once created, it cannot be modified 
(no adding or removing elements). This makes frozenset hashable, meaning 
it can be used as a dictionary key or stored in another set.

Creating a frozenset

# Creating a frozenset from a list
fs = frozenset([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(fs)  # Output: frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})

# Creating a frozenset from a set
fs2 = frozenset({10, 20, 30})
print(fs2)  # Output: frozenset({10, 20, 30})

Properties of frozenset

Immutable: No add() or remove() methods.

Supports set operations: Union, intersection, difference, etc.

Can be used as a dictionary key: Since it's hashable.


Example: Set Operations with frozenset

fs1 = frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4})
fs2 = frozenset({3, 4, 5, 6})

# Union
print(fs1 | fs2)  # frozenset({1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6})
print(fs1.union(fs2))

# Intersection
print(fs1 & fs2)  # frozenset({3, 4})
print(fs1.intersection(fs2))

# Difference
print(fs1 - fs2)  # frozenset({1, 2})
print(fs1.difference(fs2))

Using frozenset as a Dictionary Key

data = {frozenset({1, 2, 3}): "Group 1", frozenset({4, 5}): "Group 2"}
print(data[frozenset({1, 2, 3})])  # Output: Group 1


STACK

1. Using list (Built-in)

Python’s list can be used as a stack using append() to push elements 
and pop() to remove them.

stack = []

# Push elements
stack.append(10)
stack.append(20)
stack.append(30)

# Pop element
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 30
print(stack)        # Output: [10, 20]

Pros: Simple and efficient.

Cons: pop(0) (removing from front) is slow because it requires shifting 
elements. 


2. Using collections.deque (Recommended)

Python's collections.deque is optimized for fast append and pop operations 
from both ends.

from collections import deque

stack = deque()

# Push elements
stack.append(10)
stack.append(20)
stack.append(30)

# Pop element
print(stack.pop())  # Output: 30
print(stack)        # Output: deque([10, 20])

Pros: Faster than list for stack operations (O(1) for append() and pop()).

Cons: Slightly more complex than list.



3. Using queue.LifoQueue (Thread-Safe)

For thread-safe stacks, use queue.LifoQueue.

from queue import LifoQueue

stack = LifoQueue()

# Push elements
stack.put(10)
stack.put(20)
stack.put(30)

# Pop element
print(stack.get())  # Output: 30

Pros: Thread-safe.

Cons: Slightly slower due to locking.





4. Custom Stack Class

You can implement a stack using a class for better abstraction.

class Stack:
    def _init_(self):
        self.stack = []

    def push(self, item):
        self.stack.append(item)

    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.stack.pop()
        raise IndexError("Pop from empty stack")

    def peek(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.stack[-1]
        return None

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.stack) == 0

    def size(self):
        return len(self.stack)

# Usage
s = Stack()
s.push(10)
s.push(20)
print(s.pop())  # Output: 20

Pros: Encapsulates stack behavior in a reusable class.

Cons: Slightly more code.


##### SPECIAL NOTE ##########
In Python, self and _init_ are commonly used in object-oriented 
programming (OOP) when working with classes.


---

1. self

self represents the instance of the class.

It allows you to access attributes and methods of the class in Python.

It must be the first parameter of instance methods (though you can 
name it anything, self is the convention).

Example:

class MyClass:
    def _init_(self, name):  # Constructor
        self.name = name  # Assign to instance attribute

    def greet(self):  # Instance method
        print(f"Hello, {self.name}!")

obj = MyClass("Alice")  # Create an object
obj.greet()  # Output: Hello, Alice!

Here, self.name refers to the instance attribute, and self.greet() 
allows access to instance methods.

2. _init_ (Constructor)

_init_ is a special method (also called a constructor).

It is automatically called when an object of a class is created.

Used to initialize object attributes.


Example:

class Car:
    def _init_(self, brand, model):
        self.brand = brand  # Instance variable
        self.model = model

    def details(self):
        print(f"Car: {self.brand} {self.model}")

# Creating objects
car1 = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
car2 = Car("Honda", "Civic")

car1.details()  # Output: Car: Toyota Corolla
car2.details()  # Output: Car: Honda Civic

Here, _init_ sets up instance attributes brand and model when a 
Car object is created.

Key Points

self: Refers to the instance of the class and is used to access 
attributes and methods.

_init_: Initializes object attributes when a new instance is created.




Recommendation:

Use deque for performance.

Use LifoQueue for thread-safety.

Use a custom class for better structure


Queue Data Structure in Python 3

A queue is a First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure where elements 
are added at the rear and removed from the front.

Python provides multiple ways to implement a queue:




1. Using collections.deque (Recommended)

deque (double-ended queue) is fast and efficient for queue operations.

from collections import deque

queue = deque()

# Enqueue (add elements)
queue.append(10)
queue.append(20)
queue.append(30)

# Dequeue (remove elements)
print(queue.popleft())  # Output: 10
print(queue)            # Output: deque([20, 30])



Pros:

append() and popleft() are O(1) operations (fast).

Supports double-ended queue operations.

Lightweight and thread-safe for simple use cases.




2. Using queue.Queue (Thread-Safe)

Python’s queue.Queue is useful in multithreading as it handles 
locks automatically.

from queue import Queue

q = Queue()

# Enqueue
q.put(10)
q.put(20)
q.put(30)

# Dequeue
print(q.get())  # Output: 10
print(q.get())  # Output: 20

✅ Pros:

Thread-safe (handles locks automatically).


Supports blocking operations (get() waits if empty).
❌ Cons:

Slightly slower than deque due to locking overhead.



3. Using list (Not Recommended)

You can use a Python list, but removing from the front is slow (O(n)).

queue = []

# Enqueue
queue.append(10)
queue.append(20)
queue.append(30)

# Dequeue (slow)
print(queue.pop(0))  # Output: 10

❌ Cons:

pop(0) shifts all elements, making it O(n) (slow).


Priority Queue (queue.PriorityQueue)

For priority-based queues, use PriorityQueue, where elements are sorted.

from queue import PriorityQueue

pq = PriorityQueue()

# Enqueue (priority, value)
pq.put((2, "Task A"))
pq.put((1, "Task B"))  # Higher priority (1 < 2)
pq.put((3, "Task C"))

# Dequeue (sorted by priority)
print(pq.get())  # Output: (1, "Task B")
print(pq.get())  # Output: (2, "Task A")

✅ Pros:

Automatically sorts elements by priority.
❌ Cons:

Slower than deque for simple FIFO operations.



When To Use Which Queue

Queue Type             Use Case

deque                  best for general-purpose
                       queues (fast and
                       efficient).

queue.Queue           best for multithreading
                      (Thread-safe).

priorityQueue          use when
                       priority matter.


list                   Not recommended
                       for quueue (slow).


For most cases, deque is the best option unless you 
need thread safety or priority-based ordering.



STACK - LAST IN. FIRST OUT (LIFO)
QUEUE - FIRST IN, FIRST OUT (FIFO)





Here’s a custom queue class in Python with enqueue() and 
dequeue() methods.


. Simple Queue Using list

class Queue:
    def _init_(self):
        self.items = []  # Initialize an empty queue

    def enqueue(self, item):
        """Add an item to the end of the queue"""
        self.items.append(item)

    def dequeue(self):
        """Remove and return the front item from the queue"""
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop(0)  # Removes the first element
        return None  # Return None if queue is empty


def is_empty(self):
        """Check if the queue is empty"""
        return len(self.items) == 0

    def peek(self):
        """Get the front item without removing it"""
        return self.items[0] if not self.is_empty() else None

    def size(self):
        """Return the number of elements in the queue"""
        return len(self.items)

    def _str_(self):
        return f"Queue: {self.items}"


# Example Usage
q = Queue()
q.enqueue(10)
q.enqueue(20)
q.enqueue(30)

print(q)           # Output: Queue: [10, 20, 30]
print(q.dequeue()) # Output: 10 (removes first element)
print(q)           # Output: Queue: [20, 30]
print(q.peek())    # Output: 20
print(q.size())    # Output: 2

✅ Pros: Simple and easy to understand.
❌ Cons: pop(0) is O(n) since all elements shift after removal.



print(q)           # Output: Queue: [10, 20, 30]
print(q.dequeue()) # Output: 10 (removes first element)
print(q)           # Output: Queue: [20, 30]
print(q.peek())    # Output: 20
print(q.size())    # Output: 2

✅ Pros: Simple and easy to understand.
❌ Cons: pop(0) is O(n) since all elements shift after removal.




2. Efficient Queue Using collections.deque

For better performance (O(1) enqueue and dequeue), use deque.

from collections import deque

class Queue:
    def _init_(self):
        self.items = deque()

    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)  # O(1) time complexity

    def dequeue(self):
        return self.items.popleft() if not self.is_empty() else None  # O(1) time complexity

    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0

    def peek(self):
        return self.items[0] if not self.is_empty() else None

    def size(self):
        return len(self.items)

    def _str_(self):
        return f"Queue: {list(self.items)}"


# Example Usage
q = Queue()
q.enqueue("A")
q.enqueue("B")
q.enqueue("C")

print(q)           # Output: Queue: ['A', 'B', 'C']
print(q.dequeue()) # Output: 'A' (removes first element)
print(q)           # Output: Queue: ['B', 'C']

✅ Pros: Faster than list.pop(0), O(1) enqueue and dequeue.
✅ Best for large queues.
